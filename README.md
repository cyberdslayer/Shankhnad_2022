# Shankhnaad ‘22 - Hindi Festival Landing Page

### Overview
This project is a responsive landing page created for **Shankhnaad ‘22**, a Hindi festival at Rajiv Gandhi Technological University. The landing page showcases the event details, schedule, guests, and includes registration functionality. The page has been built using HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), and JavaScript with a focus on modern UI/UX principles.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: The page is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using TailwindCSS.
- **Interactive Navbar**: The navbar dynamically toggles between open/close states.
- **Image Slider**: An interactive image slider (using Splide.js) displays images from the festival.
- **Registration Call-to-Action**: A prominent section encouraging users to register for the event.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (TailwindCSS)
  - JavaScript
  - Splide.js (for image slider)
  - Font Awesome (for icons)

- **Fonts**:
  - Google Fonts (Montserrat)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shankhnaad-22-landing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd shankhnaad-22-landing
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

### Folder Structure
```
shankhnaad-22-landing/
│
├── index.html       # Main HTML page
├── style.css        # CSS styles (using Tailwind and custom styles)
├── script.js        # JavaScript functions (menu toggle, Splide slider)
├── Images/          # Folder containing all images used in the project
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

### How It Works
1. **Navbar Toggle**: The JavaScript function in `script.js` toggles the visibility of the navbar on mobile screens. 
2. **Image Slider**: The slider uses the Splide.js library for displaying images in a loop with different views for mobile and desktop.
3. **CTO Section**: A visual call-to-action (CTO) is implemented to guide users to register for the event.

### Future Improvements
- Add event schedule and guests information dynamically from a backend.
- Integrate form submission functionality for registration using a backend API.
- Add animations and transitions for a smoother user experience.
This was added to the main website.
